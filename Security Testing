Security Testing

https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html

This topic is more for the Software Architect and developers. To be honest I was not involved that much in this topic. 
Developers should know what cors, cross site scripting and CSRF is and how to prevent it. 

The cheat sheet provided above is very good example how CSRF validation errors in the logs need to be handled.

I know that one approach we used in the project was do not handle token via Cookie. 
So we made a concept where we restructured the whole CSRF handling:
	- Secured CSRF Validation Logic with Feature Flag (Recommended to minimize issues in the early phase)
	- Exclude Server2Server API's like Payment providers (mostly used in cronjobs)
	- Removed CSRF Cookie
	- Deliver CSRF-Token via personalize Request and put it in a global object
	- Add CSRF-Token to each AJAX Call via e.g. prefilter
		Verified that the token only gets added for requests to our web application and POST/PUT/... Requests

As I mentioned, this topic is huge and highly skilled devs or Software Architects need to be involved to check which approach to follow.
