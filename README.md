# Automated Tests

Just an example I am attaching some recordings from your website using Selenium IDE, which I used on Google Chrome. 
Tool is open source and it's pretty easy to use. Looks maybe even too simple and not suitable for all projects, but I would not agree with that. 
To be honest I love this tool, because it has power to go over quickly through main features on the websites, verify asserts and etc. 
Even you can do cross browsers testing. That's awesome help if you need to repeat scenarios over and over again - sometimes simple tool can save a lot of energy, time and money for the team and company. 

I just did a quick demo in search/sort&filter, maps check as well as checked Brochure downloading.. 
Of course you can implement API calls and get responses from teh server that request was really sent and etc..
